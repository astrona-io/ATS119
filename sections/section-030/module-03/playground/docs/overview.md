# Overview: Rego Policies For SBOM Content (Playground)

This is a **playground**, not a lab. It starts a fresh cluster with a registry and the workstation pod, copies two example images, and then waits. There is no task, no `astrona submit` and no pass or fail. Explore, break things, `astrona destroy`, start over.

## What's in the box

- A single-node `kind` Kubernetes cluster. `kubectl` is already pointed at it.
- An OCI registry at `registry.localtest.me:5001` inside the cluster. It uses plain HTTP, which is lab-only, so `cosign` needs `--allow-http-registry`. It holds `inventory/podinfo:6.15.0` and `inventory/podinfo:6.14.1`.
- The **workstation** pod with `cosign` v3.1.4, `regctl`, `syft`, `rekor-cli`, `gitsign`, `jq`, `git` and `openssl`. Open a shell with `kubectl -n workstation exec -it deploy/workstation -- sh`; it starts in `/work`.
- `/setup/offline-signing-config.json`, a signing configuration with no Fulcio, Rekor or timestamp service, so nothing you sign goes to a public log.

No key pair exists yet; you create one.

## Helpers

Paste these once in each new workstation shell:

```sh
export COSIGN_PASSWORD=lab-only-password
REPO=$REGISTRY/inventory/podinfo
SC=/setup/offline-signing-config.json
release_digest() { regctl image digest "$REPO:$1"; }
```

## Practice tasks

- Attach an SPDX attestation to 6.15.0, then write a Rego policy in `package signature` with an `allow` rule.
- Run `cosign verify-attestation --type spdxjson --policy policy.rego` and note how a failing rule is reported.
- Write the same check in CUE and compare with Rego.
- Add a second attestation of the same type that fails the policy and verify again.
